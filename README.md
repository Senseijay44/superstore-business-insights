## 🧩 Key Insights Summary

- **Technology** is the top-performing category in both sales and profit.
- **Furniture** has decent sales but significantly underperforms in profit — especially **Tables**, which are sold frequently but at a loss.
- **Phones** and **Copiers** dominate in both volume and profit.
- **Consumer segment** is the most profitable, while **Home Office** trails behind.
- **West and East regions** are profit leaders — the **South and Central** regions need strategic focus and shared playbooks.
- Cities like **Burbank and Jamestown** lead in **profit per order**, while **NYC and LA** dominate in volume.
- **Standard Class shipping** is preferred overall — but different sub-categories show varied preferences that could inform marketing and shipping bundling strategies.
